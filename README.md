 Class Manager by TheCampingTurret and SmartMario1 for TTT by Three Thieves.

 # Description
## About Class Manager for TTT


Every round, every player gets a class in addition to their role! These classes could give you useful items like a radar, or active abilities, like making your opponents grow or jumping great heights! This makes every round a little more unique! You can alter the chance for a class to appear, or disable them entirely by using the moderator UI with the chat command !class or !classes. If you don't have permissions on a server you hosted, you can give yourself admin in the console or just use the command class_toggle_ui.

If a user wants to reread the description of the class they got, they can use the chat command !class_desc.

## Developing additional classes

Adding more classes to the manager is made very easy. Just create an addon for TTT by Three Thieves and include terrortown.thieves and smartmario.classes_manager_ttt as package dependencies. Now you can create a class deriving from TTT_Class and add abilities just like we did for the base classes. You can see the code for all classes added in this addon in the linked GitHub.
